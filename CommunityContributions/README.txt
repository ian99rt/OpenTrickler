Notes for Front Housing: 
1) Should be printable without supports 
2) Only works with Gearless Shutters
3) Uses a 2mm x 38mm x 63mm acrylic window for the front cover: cut from https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CZHL7RZK?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1&th=1
4) Uses included servo mounting screws

Notes for GearLess Shutter:
1) Uses Shoulderbolts with needle roller bearings as pin/slot connection instead of gears
2) Allows for very fast shutter motion and should be very wear resistant

Notes for 1 Piece Volume Fillers
1) Should be printable without supports
2) Front volume filler aims to control powder all the way to the shutter without horizontal ledges

Notes for 3mm thicker Front Discharge plate
1) Steeper angle to reduce powder hanging in chute (was having issues with hidden H4350 dropping when shutter closed)
2) Requires shorter Powder cup base to fit under the thicker plate
